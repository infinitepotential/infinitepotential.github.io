        <h1> Join me on the journey to our fullest lives! </h1>
        <img src = "flowers1.jpg" width = "600">
        <p> My Name is Catherine Chan. I believe that everyone has unlimited potential! Everyone is a twinkling star in the vast universe. We can all emit our own unique light in our environments.  In the process of our growth, because of the limiting beliefs we adopted unconsciously or the habits we have been cultivated for so long, unwise choices we made in the past,  many of our potentials are dormant, a lot of our latent energy cannot be expressed freely and fully. If we don’t do something to take back the power given us from birth and start to empower ourselves, we will be drifted along with the crowd and waste our potential. I don’t want to be such a person, so I have decided to change my life. I want to share some of my stories, experiences with you, with people who share the same vision. I hope that through these sharings, we can exchange ideas and encourage each other and accelerate our growth exponentially. Let us constantly break through our obstacles and limitation and keep growing.  Let’s make the most of our potential and raise our consciousness together! This blog was born for this purpose, born for both you and me! All the best on the way to the fullest life.
